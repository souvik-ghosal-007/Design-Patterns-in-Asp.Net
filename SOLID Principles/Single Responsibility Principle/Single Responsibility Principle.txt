Single Responsibility Principle => Every Class should have a single responsibility or reason to change.

Journal class has a responsibility to add or remove queries. 
If we add the responsibility of persisting the data also in the Journal class 
then it will have two responsibilities. 
This will violate the SOLID principle.
